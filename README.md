- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Cozmo0071
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in creating small scale videogames for me and my friends.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to implement effects from AMD's FidelityFx suite.
- ðŸ“« I'm not a programmer or anything in the business, although I do know how to code, for I am a med student.
